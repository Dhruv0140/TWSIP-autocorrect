# AutoCorrect Application

This project is an AutoCorrect application built using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The application corrects the spelling of words entered by the user, utilizing a language model for suggestions and corrections.

├── README.md

```

### File Descriptions

- `app.py`: This is the main script for running the web application. It sets up the Flask server and handles HTTP requests and responses.
- `model.py`: This script contains the logic for the NLP model, including loading the model, preprocessing text, and generating corrections.
- `templates/index.html`: This is the HTML template for the web application's user interface.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)

## Installation
